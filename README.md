# Google Kickstart 2020 C++ Solutions with notes

Google Kickstart 2020 C++ solutions with notes (still working on the notes). 
Solutions in questions 3 and 4 in each round are based on the analysis from the Google Kickstart page. Notes of the code's procedure are recorded for easeir understanding for novice competitive programming learner to understand easier and for me to refresh my understanding process.  

The code tries take reference from the top winner of Google Kickstart for cleaner implementation. And tried making implementation  as self explainatory as possible for learning, understanding, and sharing purposes.
